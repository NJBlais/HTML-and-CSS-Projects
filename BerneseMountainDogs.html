	<p>Bernese Mountain dogs shed a lot but their loving nature makes that ok! Consider this quote: </p>

<blockquote cite ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog#Health">The breed standard for the Bernese mountain dog states that dogs should not be "aggressive, 			anxious or distinctly shy", but rather should be "good-natured", "self-assured", "placid towards strangers", and "docile".
